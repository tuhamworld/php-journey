<?php

// PHP has nine predefined constants that change value depending on where they are used, and therefor they are called "magic constants". They are identified with double underscores at the beginning and at the end.

// __CLASS__    - If used inside a class, the class name is returned.	
// __DIR__      - The directory of the file.	
// __FILE__     -The file name including the full path.	
// __FUNCTION__	   - If inside a function, the function name is returned.	
// __LINE__	    - The current line number.	
// __METHOD__	    - If used inside a function that belongs to a class, both class and function name is returned.	
// __NAMESPACE__	- If used inside a namespace, the name of the namespace is returned.	
// __TRAIT__	    - If used inside a trait, the trait name is returned.



// The magin constants are case-insensitive meaning __LINE__ returns same thing with __line__
