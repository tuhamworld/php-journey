// JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and is a syntax for storing and exchanging data.

// Since the JSON format is a text-based format, it can easily be sent to and from a server, and used as a data format by any programming language.

// PHP and JSON
// PHP has some built-in functions to handle JSON.

// First, we will look at the following two functions:

// json_encode() - The json_encode() function is used to encode a value to JSON format.
// json_decode() - The json_decode() function is used to decode a JSON object into a PHP object or an associative array.
