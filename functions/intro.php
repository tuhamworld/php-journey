// The real power of PHP comes from its functions.
// PHP has over 1000 built-in functions and you can also create your own functions

// What is a Function?
//  A function is a block of statements that can be used repeatedly in a program. Functions does not automatically run when the page loads. Functions run when a call is made to the function

// Tip: Give the function a name that represents what it does?
