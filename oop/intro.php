// Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.


// Some Advantages of OOP includes:

// OOP is faster and easier to execute
// OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
// OOP helps to keep the PHP code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
// OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time


// Classes and Objects are the two main concepts in OOP

// Example of a Class can be refered to as "Fruits" while objects are "Orange, Guava, Mangoes, Pineapple..."
// So a class is a template for an object, while an object is an instance of a class.
