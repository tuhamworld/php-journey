<?php

// Loops allows you to run same block of codes over and over again for a specified number of times or for a certain condition without having to write almost-equal codes all over again and again

// In PHP, we have the following loop types:

// while - loops through a block of code as long as the specified condition is true
// do...while - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as the specified condition is true
// for - loops through a block of code a specified number of times
// foreach - loops through a block of code for each element in an array
